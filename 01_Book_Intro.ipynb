In the Pet dataset, each image is labeled using its filename (e.g., \"great_pyrenees_173.jpg\"): it starts with an uppercase letter if the image is a cat, and a lowercase letter otherwise. is_cat returns x[0].isupper(), which evaluates to True if the first letter is uppercase (i.e., it's a cat).\n",

    "- valid_pct = tells fastai to hold out 20% of the data (validation set), another 80% is training set. By default, the 20% that is held out is selected randomly.\n",
    "- seed = sets the random seed to the same value every time we run this code, which means we get the same validation set every time we run it—this way, if we change our model and retrain it, we know that any differences are due to the changes to the model, not due to having a different random validation set.\n",

    "  item_tfms are applied to each item (in this case, each item is resized to a 224-pixel square)  \n",

    "  Why 224 pixels? This is the standard size for historical reasons (old pretrained models require this size exactly), but you can pass pretty much anything.

Another common metric for classification is accuracy (which is just 1.0 - error_rate).\n",

When using a pretrained model, vision_learner will remove the last layer, since that is always specifically customized to the original training task (i.e. ImageNet dataset classification), and replace it with one or more new layers with randomized weights, of an appropriate size for the dataset you are working with.
